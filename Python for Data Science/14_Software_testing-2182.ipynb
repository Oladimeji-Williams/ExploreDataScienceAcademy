    "\n",
    "There are four primary levels in software testing - each concerned with testing the software at different levels of granularity:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Unit testing\n",
    "2. Integration testing\n",
    "3. System testing\n",

    "### Unit Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit tests ensure that small fundamental pieces of code, known as units, behave correctly when invoked in isolation. Examples of code units include functions or class methods and are defined with clear parameters and scope. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use another story to illustrate why unit testing is so important, in 1994 shortly after Intel introduced its Pentium microprocessor, it was found to perform some calculations incorrectly. It was discovered that a table was not being fully initialised; a few cells contained zero instead of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intel claimed to have run millions of tests “using this table”, however, these were probably system tests.\n",

    "\n",
    "Intel had to recall the chip at the cost of millions of dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Related to unit testing is the process of module testing. Several units of code make up a module, which often has a larger area of responsibility than a single function would. For example, a single Python script which you run in order to perform a task could be considered as a software module. Here it is important to note that after unit testing is performed, we still need to validate that the units *interact* with each other correctly. This intermediate testing level is known as module testing.    "

    "### Using a Debugger\n",
    "\n",
    "A far simpler and more convenient way of debugging your code is to use an actual debugger.  A debugger is a tool for executing an application where the programmer can carefully control the execution flow of the application, and inspect the values taken on by variables during this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The features of a debugger include:\n",
    "* Stepping through code one instruction at a time. \n",
    "* Viewing the current values maintained by all variables at each time step.  \n",
    "* Insertion and removal of breakpoints to pause execution when a certain line of code is reached. \n"
